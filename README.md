Sales Revenue Prediction â€“ End-to-End ML Pipeline  


 ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts sales revenue based on various business factors like product category, marketing spend, customer segment, and economic indicators.
It is built as a production-ready ML pipeline with:
âœ… Data Versioning (DVC)
âœ… Experiment Tracking (MLflow via DAGsHub)
âœ… Model Deployment (FastAPI)

ðŸš€ Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles numerical & categorical features using pipelines.

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV integrated with MLflow tracking.

Model Logging & Metrics: RÂ², MAE, MSE stored in MLflow.

DVC for Data Versioning: Full reproducibility for datasets.

REST API Deployment: FastAPI for real-time predictions.

Cloud Tracking: MLflow hosted on DAGsHub.
